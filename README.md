# Vitalis

A next-generation health supplement e-commerce platform built with Next.js.

## Authentication Issue Fix

We fixed an issue where the navbar wasn't updating correctly when a user signed in. The problem was related to how the authentication state was being managed and synchronized across components. Here's what we did:

1. Enhanced the `AuthProvider` in `lib/auth-context.tsx`:

   - Added custom events to notify components of authentication state changes
   - Improved error handling for JSON parsing
   - Added proper event dispatching for authentication events

2. Updated the `UserMenu` component in `components/user-menu.tsx`:

   - Added state tracking to force re-renders when authentication changes
   - Added event listeners for custom auth events
   - Improved UI components to show proper authenticated/unauthenticated state
   - Fixed styling issues with Lucide icons and Button components

3. Created a proper sign-in page in `app/sign-in/page.tsx` to test the authentication flow

## How to Test

1. Run the application with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the sign-in page
3. Sign in with any email that contains an `@` symbol and any password
4. Verify that the navbar updates properly to show the authenticated user state
5. Test sign out functionality as well

## Development

This project uses:

- Next.js for the framework
- ShadcnUI for components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

To start development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The application can be built using:

```bash
npm run build
```

And then deployed to any hosting platform that supports Next.js applications.
