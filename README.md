# Vitalis

A next-generation health supplement e-commerce platform built with Next.js.

## Authentication Issue Fix

We fixed an issue where the navbar wasn't updating correctly when a user signed in. The problem was related to how the authentication state was being managed and synchronized across components. Here's what we did:

1. Enhanced the `AuthProvider` in `lib/auth-context.tsx`:

   - Added custom events to notify components of authentication state changes
   - Improved error handling for JSON parsing
   - Added proper event dispatching for authentication events

2. Updated the `UserMenu` component in `components/user-menu.tsx`:

   - Added state tracking to force re-renders when authentication changes
   - Added event listeners for custom auth events
   - Improved UI components to show proper authenticated/unauthenticated state
   - Fixed styling issues with Lucide icons and Button components

3. Created a proper sign-in page in `app/sign-in/page.tsx` to test the authentication flow

## How to Test

1. Run the application with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the sign-in page
3. Sign in with any email that contains an `@` symbol and any password
4. Verify that the navbar updates properly to show the authenticated user state
5. Test sign out functionality as well

## Development

This project uses:

- Next.js for the framework
- ShadcnUI for components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

To start development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The application can be built using:

```bash
npm run build
```

And then deployed to any hosting platform that supports Next.js applications.

## Cart and Checkout Flow

The shopping experience is designed with a clear separation between cart and checkout:

### Cart Flow (/cart)

- The cart page shows all items added by the user
- Users can modify quantities or remove items
- Displays subtotal, shipping costs, and order total
- "Continue Shopping" button takes users back to the product listings
- "Proceed to Checkout" button advances to the checkout process

### Checkout Flow (/checkout)

- A streamlined two-step process:
  1. Shipping information and method selection
  2. Payment method and details
- Each step shows a summary of the cart items (read-only)
- Progress indicator shows the current step in the process
- "Edit Cart" link allows users to return to the cart if needed
- Confirmation page is shown after successful purchase

## Navigation

- The cart icon in the site header always links to the /cart page
- The checkout page is only accessible after viewing the cart
- Users can move back and forth between cart and checkout as needed
